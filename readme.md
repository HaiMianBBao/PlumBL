# PLUM_BOOTLOADER
This is a lightweight microcontroller bootloader. At present, you can use u2f, dfu-util.exe tools, to complete the firmware upgrade. At the same time, it is also portable and can be easily transplanted to other chips. It only needs to implement the interface under the port folder. At present, I have finished the transplantation of ch58x series, ch32v30x, stm32f401, stm32f103, stm32l433.

Ch58x You need to decide whether to jump to the app.
```
bool lgk_boot_app_is_vaild(uint32_t check_code_add)
{
    /*!< Your code >*/
    return true;
}
```
# Clone
## step 1
```
git clone https://github.com/HaiMianBBao/PlumBL.git
or
git clone git@github.com:HaiMianBBao/PlumBL.git
```
## step 2
```
cd PlumBL
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

# Build
## uf2
```
cd examples/xxx
make or make BL_TYPE=uf2
```

## dfu
```
cd examples/xxx
make BL_TYPE=dfu
```

## mcu boot
```
cd examples/xxx
make BL_TYPE=uf2 USE_MCU_BOOT=yes
or
make BL_TYPE=dfu USE_MCU_BOOT=yes
```

# Make APP file
```
ch58x:
#define BOARD_FLASH_APP_START 0x00010000UL

ch32v30x:
#define BOARD_FLASH_APP_START 0x08010000UL

stm32f103:
#define BOARD_FLASH_APP_START 0x08005000UL

stm32f401:
#define BOARD_FLASH_APP_START 0x08010000UL

stm32l433:
#define BOARD_FLASH_APP_START 0x08010000UL
```
You need to set the starting address of your firmware to BOARD_FLASH_APP_START. You can modify the link file in your own project file to achieve this purpose.
When you have the xxx. hex file, you only need to go to the official side of UF2 to get the uf2conv.py and uf2Families.json files.
## uf2
```
ch58x:
#define BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID  0xabcdc582 // BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID is defined in uf2.h

ch32v30x:
#define BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID  0xabcdc320 // BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID is defined in uf2.h

stm32f103:
#define BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID  0xabcdf103 // BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID is defined in uf2.h

stm32f401:
#define BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID  0xabcdf401 // BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID is defined in uf2.h

stm32l433:
#define BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID  0xabcd1433 // BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID is defined in uf2.h

Then you can run:
hex:
python uf2conv.py xxx.hex -o xxx.uf2 -c -f BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID

bin:
1、Do not use mcuboot
python uf2conv.py xxx.bin -o xxx.uf2 -c -f BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID -b BOARD_FLASH_APP_START

2、Use mcuboot
python uf2conv.py xxx.bin -o xxx.uf2 -c -f BOARD_UF2_FAMILY_ID -b BOARD_FLASH_APP_START - HEAD_SIZE
The HEAD_SIZE default value is 0x1000
```
The you can drag the .uf2 file into the u disk to download.

## dfu
DfuSeDemo is the official dfu burning software of ST, but it needs to make bin files into dfu files before it can be used. When you install DfuSeDemo, the production software of bin to dfu will be automatically installed. You can choose this method, but I do not recommend it.

Another way to use dfu on windows is through dfu-util.exe. Other platforms need to be explored on your own. Here we use ch58x as an example. The windows steps are as follows:

### Step1
Run zadig-2.7.exe under the utils folder and make sure your device is in dfu mode.
Click Options and List All Devices, as shown in the figure below. You can see the device PlumBootloader, and select it,

and click Replace Driver to replace the driver with winusb,

### Step2
Now you can open the terminal under the utils folder and input ./CH58x_dfu_util.sh
if successfull,you will see:
```
./CH58x_dfu_util.sh
dfu-util 0.11
